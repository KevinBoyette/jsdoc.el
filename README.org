* jsdoc.el
Inserts [[https://jsdoc.app/][JSDoc]] function comments/typedefs easily. It also tries to infer types by itself while doing that. Type inference is quite primitive.

[[file:./jsdoc.gif]]

* Why?
I was trying to find something to do with [[https://github.com/ubolonton/emacs-tree-sitter][tree-sitter]] to learn it and I like to document my code. There you have it.

- Also: For functions with JSDocs, LSP-mode will show us the types and function description in a neato pop-up to the side.

* Usage
Use the interactive command =jsdoc=. If the cursor is on a function definition, it inserts a JSDoc style function documentation comment. If the cursor is on a JavaScript object, it inserts a JSDoc =@typedef=.

* Installation
Not yet on Melpa, but if you have `quelpa/use-package`:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; [Minimal Type Inference] When default values are provided, then we can infer
;; the type of the arguments.
;;
;; Use: Run “M-x jsdoc” on a JS function.
;;
(use-package jsdoc
  :ensure t
  :quelpa (jsdoc
           :fetcher github
           :repo "isamert/jsdoc.el")
  :config
   (use-package tree-sitter)        ;; Required dependencies
   (use-package tree-sitter-langs)
  :hook (js-mode . tree-sitter-mode))
#+end_src

- [[https://github.com/ananthakumaran/tide][ananthakumaran/tide]] :: The command =tide-jsdoc-template= inserts a JSDoc template for your function. It's meant to be simple, no advanced stuff. It also requires ~tide-mode~ enabled (which runs ~tsserver~).
- [[https://github.com/mooz/js-doc][mooz/js-doc]] ::  Another package in the spirit of this one. Seems to have quite advanced stuff but didn't get it to work. Haven't got updated for a while.
