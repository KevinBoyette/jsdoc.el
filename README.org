* jsdoc.el
Inserts [[https://jsdoc.app/][JSDoc]] function comments/typedefs easily. It also tries to infer types by itself while doing that. Type inference is quite primitive.

* Why?
I was trying to find something to do with [[https://github.com/ubolonton/emacs-tree-sitter][tree-sitter]] to learn it and I like to document my code. There you have it.

* Usage
Use the interactive command =jsdoc=. If the cursor is on a function definition, it inserts a JSDoc style function documentation comment. If the cursor is on a JavaScript object, it inserts a JSDoc style =@typedef=.
